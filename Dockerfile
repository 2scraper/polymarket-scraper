# `playwright install chromium`, and unlike a sibling repo that is not a
# compromise. Polymarket does not read the client at all: the bundled
# Chromium was served HTTP 200 and the full payload on all twelve captures
# taken for this repo, and so was a `curl` announcing itself as `curl/8.0`.
# Chromium is also several hundred MB smaller than Chrome.
#
# `--with-deps` also pulls Chromium's shared-library dependencies through
# apt, which are not pip packages and so cannot ride in requirements.txt.

# Every module playwright_scraper.py imports, transitively, plus diff_runs.py

# against the entrypoint's real import graph: three repos in this family
# shipped an image missing proxy_pool.py, which the engine imports at module
# level, so it died with ModuleNotFoundError on every invocation INCLUDING
# `--help` — a broken container that nothing in the repo would have noticed.

# accepted and needs a display.
